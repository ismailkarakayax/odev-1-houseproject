# House Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of three types of houses: House, Mansion, and VacationHouse. It includes a class that creates at least three instances of each type and provides methods to retrieve these instances (`getHouseList`, `getVillaList`, `getVacationHomeList`). Additionally, a service class is provided with methods to calculate total prices, average areas, and filter homes based on room and living room counts.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/org.ismailkarakayax.entity` contains classes representing different types of houses.
- `src/main/java/org.ismailkarakayax.service` contains the service class and interface with methods to perform calculations on house instances.
- `src/main/java/org.ismailkarakayax` contains the main class demonstrating the usage of the classes and service.

### Run the Application:

Run the `Main` class to perform various operations on different types of houses.
